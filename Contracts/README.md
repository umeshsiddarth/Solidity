## [EmployeeSalaryStorage.sol](/EmployeeSalaryStorage.sol)
In this solidity contract I learnt about the basic data types, keywords, functions, storage functions etc.

The key learnings are declaring the variables, constructing a struct, using the struct and declaring a variable, using mapping, and constructing a function.

Using the struct and mapping I created a simple Employee and Salary list. Using this contract we can have a database of employees with their respective salary list. We can get the salary by knowing the name of the person.
